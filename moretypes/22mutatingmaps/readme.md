# Mutating Maps

Insert or update an element in map `m`:

```go
m[key] = elem
```

Retrieve an element:

```go
elem = m[key]
```

Delete an element:

```go
delete(m, key)
```

Test that a key is present with a two-value assignment:

```go
elem, ok = m[key]
```

If `key` is in `m`, `ok` is `true`. If not, `ok` is `false`.

If `key` is not in the map, then `elem` is the zero value for the map's element type.

Note: if `elem` or `ok` have not yet been declared you could use a short declaration form:

```go
elem, ok := m[key]
```
